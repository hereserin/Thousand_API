Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge) is a collegiate public research university in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209 and granted a Royal Charter by King Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university.[9] The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople.[10] The two 'ancient universities' share many common features and are often referred to jointly as 'Oxbridge'. The history and influence of the University of Cambridge has made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[11]\n", "Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 constituent Colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools. Cambridge University Press, a department of the university, is the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum, as well as a botanic garden. Cambridge's libraries hold a total of around 15 million books, eightÂ million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library.\n", "In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2018, the university had a total income of Â£1.965Â billion, of which Â£515.5 million was from research grants and contracts.[12] In the financial year ending 2017, the central university and colleges had combined net assets of around Â£11.8Â billion, the largest of any university in the country.[13] However, the true extent of Cambridge's wealth is much higher as many colleges hold their historic main sites, which date as far back as the 13th century, at depreceated valuations. Furthermore, many of the wealthiest colleges do not account for âheritage assetsâ such as works of art, libraries or artefacts, whose value many college accounts describe as âimmaterialâ.[14] The university is closely linked with the development of the high-tech business cluster known as 'Silicon Fen'. It is a member of numerous associations and forms part of the 'golden triangle' of English universities and Cambridge University Health Partners, an academic health science centre.\n", "As of 2018, Cambridge is the top-ranked university in the United Kingdom according to all major league tables. As of SeptemberÂ 2017[update], Cambridge is ranked the world's second best university by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[15] and is ranked 3rd worldwide by Academic Ranking of World Universities, 6th by QS, and 7th by US News.[16][17][18] According to the Times Higher Education ranking, no other institution in the world ranks in the top 10 for as many subjects.[19] The university has educated many notable alumni, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, politicians, lawyers, philosophers, writers, actors and foreign Heads of State. As of MarchÂ 2019[update], 118 Nobel Laureates, 11 Fields Medalists, 7 Turing Award winners and 15 British Prime Ministers have been affiliated with Cambridge as students, alumni, faculty or research staff.[20]\n", "By the late 12th century, the Cambridge area already had a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation, due to monks from the nearby bishopric church of Ely. However, it was an incident at Oxford which is most likely to have led to the establishment of the university: two Oxford scholars were hanged by the town authorities for the death of a woman, without consulting the ecclesiastical authorities, who would normally take precedence (and pardon the scholars) in such a case, but were at that time in conflict with King John. The University of Oxford went into suspension[clarification needed] in protest, and most scholars moved to cities such as Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. After the University of Oxford reformed several years later, enough scholars remained in Cambridge to form the nucleus of the new university.[21] In order to claim precedence, it is common for Cambridge to trace its founding to the 1231 charter from King HenryÂ III granting it the right to discipline its own members (ius non-trahi extra) and an exemption from some taxes; Oxford was not granted similar rights until 1248.[22]\n", "A bull in 1233 from Pope Gregory IX gave graduates from Cambridge the right to teach \"everywhere in Christendom\".[23] After Cambridge was described as a studium generale in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[24] and confirmed as such in a bull by Pope John XXII in 1318,[25] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or to give lecture courses.[24]\n", "The colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the system. No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some traces, such as the name of Garret Hostel Lane.[26]\n", "Hugh Balsham, Bishop of Ely, founded Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, in 1284. Many colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, but colleges continued to be established until modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recently established college is Robinson, built in the late 1970s. However, Homerton College only achieved full university college status in March 2010, making it the newest full college (it was previously an \"Approved Society\" affiliated with the university).\n", "In medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members would pray for the souls of the founders, and were often associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus changed in 1536 with the Dissolution of the Monasteries. King Henry VIII ordered the university to disband its Faculty of Canon Law[27] and to stop teaching \"scholastic philosophy\". In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law, and towards the classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n", "Nearly a century later, the university was at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals and even commoners saw the ways of the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church, and felt that it was used by the Crown to usurp the rightful powers of the counties. East Anglia was the centre of what became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine's Hall, Sidney Sussex and Christ's College.[28] They produced many \"non-conformist\" graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who left for New England and especially the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s. Oliver Cromwell, Parliamentary commander during the English Civil War and head of the English Commonwealth (1649â1660), attended Sidney Sussex.\n", "Examination in mathematics was once compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the main first degree at Cambridge in both arts and sciences. From the time of Isaac Newton in the later 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, particularly mathematical physics. The exam is known as a Tripos.[29] Students awarded first-class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos are termed wranglers, and the top student among them is the Senior Wrangler. The Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Lord Rayleigh.[30] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the system, feeling that people were too interested in accumulating marks in exams and not interested in the subject itself.\n", "Pure mathematics at Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, but also missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. Pure mathematical research at Cambridge finally reached the highest international standard in the early 20th century, thanks above all to G. H. Hardy, his collaborator J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. In geometry, W. V. D. Hodge brought Cambridge into the international mainstream in the 1930s.\n", "Although diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. Cambridge alumni have won six Fields Medals and one Abel Prize for mathematics, while individuals representing Cambridge have won four Fields Medals.[31]\n", "After the Cambridge University Act formalised the organisational structure of the university, the study of many new subjects was introduced, such as theology, history and modern languages.[32] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam, of Trinity College, who also founded the Fitzwilliam Museum.[33] Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to build the Downing Site, with new scientific laboratories for anatomy, genetics and Earth sciences.[34] During the same period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to the West Cambridge Site, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[35]\n", "The University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century. The first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[36]\n", "In the First World War, 13,878 members of the university served and 2,470 were killed. Teaching, and the fees it earned, came almost to a stop and severe financial difficulties followed. As a consequence the university first received systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal Commission appointed in 1920 recommended that the university (but not the colleges) should receive an annual grant.[37] Following the Second World War, the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places; this was partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[38]\n", "The university was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of eight represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal Charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950, when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948.\n", "The constituency was not a geographical area. Its electorate consisted of the graduates of the university. Before 1918 the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n", "For many years only male students were enrolled into the university. The first colleges for women were Girton College (founded by Emily Davies) in 1869 and Newnham College in 1872 (founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick), followed by Hughes Hall in 1885 (founded by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women), Murray Edwards College (founded by Rosemary Murray as New Hall) in 1954, and Lucy Cavendish College in 1965. The first women students were examined in 1882 but attempts to make women full members of the university did not succeed until 1948.[39] Women were allowed to study courses, sit examinations, and have their results recorded from 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the twentieth century, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin.[40]\n", "From 1921 women were awarded diplomas which \"conferred the Title of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts\". As they were not \"admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts\" they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. Darwin College, the first wholly graduate college of the university, matriculated both men and women students from its inception in 1964 â and elected a mixed fellowship. Of the undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare and King's Colleges, the former men's colleges began to admit women between 1972 and 1988. One of the female-only colleges, Girton, also began to admit male students from 1979, but the other female-only colleges did not do likewise. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford, ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining United Kingdom university with female-only colleges (Newnham, Murray Edwards and Lucy Cavendish).[41][42] In the academic year 2004â5, the university's student sex ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48%.[43]\n", "As an institution with such a long history, the university has developed a large number of myths and legends. The vast majority of these are untrue, but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n", "A discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the 'prize' awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit. This made it harder to ascertain who was \"entitled\" to the spoon (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.\n", "Each Christmas Eve, BBC radio and television broadcasts The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols sung by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas tradition since it was first transmitted in 1928 (though the festival has existed since 1918). The radio broadcast is carried worldwide by the BBC World Service and is also syndicated to hundreds of radio stations in the US. The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[44][45]\n", "The university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge, with the students taking up a significant proportion (nearly 20%) of the town's population and heavily affecting the age structure.[46] Most of the older colleges are situated nearby the city centre and river Cam, along which it is traditional to punt to appreciate the buildings and surroundings.[47]\n", "Examples of notable buildings include King's College Chapel,[48] the history faculty building[49] designed by James Stirling; and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[50] The brickwork of several of the colleges is also notable: Queens' College contains \"some of the earliest patterned brickwork in the country\"[51] and the brick walls of St John's College provide examples of English bond, Flemish bond and Running bond.[52]\n", "The university is divided into several sites where the different departments are placed. The main ones are:[53]\n", "The university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital where students in medicine undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree,[54] while the West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host a new sports development.[55] In addition, the Judge Business School, situated on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses since 1990 and is consistently ranked within the top 20 business schools globally by the Financial Times.[56]\n", "Given that the sites are in relative close proximity to each other and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle: a fifth of the journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits, except under special circumstances.[57]\n", "The relationship between the university and the city has not always been positive. The phrase town and gown is employed to differentiate inhabitants of Cambridge from students at the university, who historically wore academical dress. There are many stories of ferocious rivalry between the two categories: in 1381, strong clashes brought about attacks and looting of university properties while locals contested the privileges granted by the government to the academic staff. Following these events, the Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute the criminals and re-establish order in the city. Attempts to reconcile the two groups followed over time, and in the 16th century agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague hit Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to help those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[58]\n", "Nowadays, these conflicts have somewhat subsided and the university has become an opportunity for employment among the population, providing an increased level of wealth in the area.[59] The enormous growth in the number of high-tech, biotech, providers of services and related firms situated near Cambridge has been termed the Cambridge Phenomenon: the addition of 1,500 new, registered companies and as many as 40,000 jobs between 1960 and 2010 has been directly related to the presence and importance of the university.[60]\n", "Cambridge is a collegiate university, meaning that it is made up of self-governing and independent colleges, each with its own property and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines, and within each faculty, school or department within the university, academics from many different colleges will be found.\n", "The faculties are responsible for ensuring that lectures are given, arranging seminars, performing research and determining the syllabi for teaching, overseen by the General Board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, they make up the entire Cambridge University. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the university (the Cambridge University Library), by the Faculties (Faculty libraries such as the Squire Law Library), and by the individual colleges (all of which maintain a multi-discipline library, generally aimed mainly at their undergraduates).\n", "The colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisionsâsmall-group teaching sessions, often with just one studentâwithin the colleges (though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in the areas concerned). Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.\n", "Cambridge has 31 colleges, of which three, Murray Edwards, Newnham and Lucy Cavendish, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed, though most were originally all-male. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women, while Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates, in 1972. Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women, in 1988.[61] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish, St Edmund's and Wolfson admit only mature (i.e. 21 years or older on date of matriculation) students, encompassing both undergraduate and graduate students. All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students with no age restrictions.\n", "Colleges are not required to admit students in all subjects, with some colleges choosing not to offer subjects such as architecture, history of art or theology, but most offer close to the complete range. Some colleges maintain a bias towards certain subjects, for example with Churchill leaning towards the sciences and engineering,[62] while others such as St Catharine's aim for a balanced intake.[63] Others maintain much more informal reputations, such as for the students of King's to hold left-wing political views,[64] or Robinson's and Churchill's attempts to minimise their environmental impact.[65]\n", "Costs to students (accommodation and food prices) vary considerably from college to college.[66][67] Similarly, college expenditure on student education also varies widely between individual colleges.[68]\n", "There are also several theological colleges in Cambridge, separate from Cambridge University, including Westcott House, Westminster College and Ridley Hall Theological College, that are, to a lesser degree, affiliated to the university and are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation.[69]\n", "The 31 colleges are:[70]\n", "In addition to the 31 colleges, the university is made up of over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates and other institutions.[71] Members of these are usually also members of one of the colleges and responsibility for running the entire academic programme of the university is divided amongst them. The university also has a centre for part-time study, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is housed in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire.\n", "A \"School\" in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory bodyâthe \"Council\" of the schoolâcomprising representatives of the constituent bodies. There are six schools:[72]\n", "Teaching and research in Cambridge is organised by faculties. The faculties have different organisational sub-structures which partly reflect their history and partly their operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. In addition, a small number of bodies called 'Syndicates' have responsibilities for teaching and research, e.g. Cambridge Assessment, the University Press, and the University Library.\n", "The office of Chancellor of the university, for which there are no term limits, is mainly ceremonial and is held by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, following the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the official Nomination Board to succeed him,[73] and Abdul Arain, owner of a local grocery store, Brian Blessed and Michael Mansfield were also nominated.[74][75][76] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011.[76] David Sainsbury won the election taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, winning on the first count.\n", "The current Vice-Chancellor is Stephen Toope.[77] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor is the de facto principal administrative officer of the university. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by its own members,[78] with very little external representation on its governing body, the Regent House (though there is external representation on the Audit Committee, and there are four external members on the University's Council, who are the only external members of the Regent House).[79]\n", "The Senate consists of all holders of the MA degree or higher degrees. It elects the Chancellor and the High Steward, and elected two members of the House of Commons until the Cambridge University constituency was abolished in 1950. Prior to 1926, it was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that the Regent House fulfils today.[80] The Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the University and the Colleges, together with the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[81] The public representatives of the Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year, on the nomination of the Colleges.\n", "Although the University Council is the principal executive and policy-making body of the university, it must report and be accountable to the Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. It has the right of reporting to the university, and is obliged to advise the Regent House on matters of general concern to the university. It does both of these by causing notices to be published by authority in the Cambridge University Reporter, the official journal of the university. Since January 2005, the membership of the Council has included two external members,[82] and the Regent House voted for an increase from two to four in the number of external members in March 2008,[83][84] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[85]\n", "The General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the academic and educational policy of the university,[86] and is accountable to the Council for its management of these affairs.\n", "Faculty Boards are responsible to the General Board; other Boards and Syndicates are responsible either to the General Board (if primarily for academic purposes) or to the Council. In this way, the various arms of the university are kept under the supervision of the central administration, and thus the Regent House.\n", "In 2006â7, it was reported that approximately one third of Cambridge's income comes from UK government funding for teaching and research, with another third coming from other research grants. Endowment income contributes around Â£130Â million. The university also receives a significant income in annual transfers from the Cambridge University Press.[87]\n", "In 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210Â million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow the Gates Scholarships for students from outside the UK seeking postgraduate study at Cambridge.[citation needed]\n", "In the year ended 31 July 2013 the university had a total income of Â£1.44Â billion, of which Â£332Â million was from research grants and contracts.[88]\n", "The University of Cambridge borrowed Â£350Â million by issuing a 40-year security bond in October 2012.[89] Its interest rate is about 0.6 percent higher than a British government 40-year bond. Vice chancellor Leszek Borysiewicz hailed the success of the issue.[90] In a 2010 report, the Russell Group of 20 leading universities made a conclusion that higher education could be financed by issuing bonds.[89]\n", "Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities, and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of research intensive and southern English universities.[91] It is also closely linked with the development of the high-tech business cluster known as \"Silicon Fen\", and as part of the Cambridge University Health Partners, an academic health science centre.\n", "Undergraduate applications to Cambridge must be made through UCAS in time for the early deadline, currently mid-October in the year before starting. Until the 1980s candidates for all subjects were required to sit special entrance examinations,[96] since replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and the Cambridge Law Test.[97] The university is considering reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects with effect from 2016.[98] The university gives offers of admission to 33.5% of its applicants, the 2nd lowest amongst the Russell Group.[99] The acceptance rate for students in the 2014â2015 cycle was 21.0%.[100]\n", "Most applicants who are called for interview will have been predicted at least three A-grade A-level qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or the equivalent in other qualifications, such as getting at least 7,7,6 for higher-level subjects at IB. The A* A-level grade (introduced in 2010) now plays a part in the acceptance of applications, with the university's standard offer for most courses being set at A*AA,[101][102] with A*A*A for sciences courses. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, the interview process is needed for distinguishing between the most able candidates. The interview is performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity.[103] For exceptional candidates, a Matriculation Offer was sometimes previously offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. In 2006, 5,228 students who were rejected went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 63% of all applicants rejected.[104] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[105]\n", "Strong applicants who are not successful at their chosen college may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be offered places by other colleges. This is in order to maintain consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n", "Graduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department relating to the applicant's subject. When an offer is made, this effectively guarantees admission to a collegeâthough not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice.[106]\n", "Public debate in the United Kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry. In 2007â08, 57% of all successful applicants were from state schools[109] (roughly 93 percent of all students in the UK attend state schools). Critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxbridge's reputation for many years, and the university has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for Cambridge to help redress the imbalance.[110] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[111][112] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, and such applicants now form a (very large) minority (43%)[109][113] of the intake. In 2005, 32% of the 3599 applicants from independent schools were admitted to Cambridge, as opposed to 24% of the 6674 applications from state schools.[114] In 2008 the University of Cambridge received a gift of Â£4m to improve its accessibility to candidates from maintained schools.[115] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, is among those universities that have adopted formulae that gives a rating to the GCSE performance of every school in the country to \"weight\" the scores of university applicants.[116][not in citation given]\n", "With the release of admissions figures, a 2013 article in The Guardian reported that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was hence criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination by stating the figures did not take into account \"other variables\".[117] A following article stated that in the years 2010â2012 ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The University refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects claiming it would be too costly.[118]\n", "There are a number of educational consultancies that offer support with the applications process. Some make claims of improved chances of admission but these claims are not independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated to or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all important information regarding the application process is public knowledge and none of these services is providing any inside information.[119]\n", "Cambridge University has been criticised because many colleges admit a low proportion of black students though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge 6 admitted fewer than 10 black or mixed race students from 2012 to 2016.[120]\n", "The academic year is divided into three academic terms, determined by the Statutes of the University.[121] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; Lent term from January to March; and Easter term from April to June.\n", "Within these terms undergraduate teaching takes place within eight-week periods called Full Terms. According to the university statutes, it is a requirement that during this period all students should live within 3 miles of the Church of St Mary the Great; this is defined as Keeping term. Students can graduate only if they fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) when obtaining a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when studying for a Master of Science, Engineering or Mathematics.[122]\n", "These terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[123] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter and Long Vacations).\n", "Triposes involve a mixture of lectures (organised by the university departments), and supervisions (organised by the colleges). Science subjects also involve laboratory sessions, organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students (usually between one and three) meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of the supervision, which they will discuss with the supervisor during the session, along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week's lectures. The assignment is often an essay on a subject set by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students might receive between one and four supervisions per week.[124] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford (where \"supervisions\" are known as \"tutorials\")[125] and Cambridge.\n", "A tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[126]\n", "The University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines. All research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are in charge of giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues on a number of sites.[127]\n", "Cambridge also has a research partnership with MIT in the United States: the CambridgeâMIT Institute.\n", "Unlike in most universities, the Cambridge Master of Arts is not awarded by merit of study, but by right, four years after being awarded the BA.\n", "At the University of Cambridge, each graduation is a separate act of the university's governing body, the Regent House, and must be voted on as with any other act. A formal meeting of the Regent House, known as a Congregation, is held for this purpose.[128]\nThis is the common last act at which all the different university procedures (for: undergraduate and graduate students; and the different degrees) land. After degrees are approved, to have them conferred candidates must ask their Colleges to be presented during a Congregation. \n", "Graduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating: for example, most students becoming Bachelors of Arts wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a postgraduate degree (e.g. PhD or Master's) wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating, only if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree is from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive, the BA gown without the strings if they are under 24 years of age, or the MA gown without strings if they are 24 and over.[129] Graduates are presented in the Senate House college by college, in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the royal colleges.\n", "During the congregation, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their college, who takes them by the right hand, and presents them to the vice-chancellor for the degree they are about to take. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement (the following forms were used when the vice-chancellor was female), substituting \"____\" with the name of the degree:\n", "\"Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum _____; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.\n", "    (Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.)\"\n", "and female graduands with the following:\n", "    \"Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hanc mulierem quam scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneam ad gradum assequendum ____; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.\n", "    (Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this woman whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.)\"\n", "After presentation, the graduand is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statementâthe Trinitarian formula (in nomine Patris...) may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n", "    \"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum ____, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.\n", "    (By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of ____, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.)\"\n", "The now-graduate then rises, bows and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door, where he or she receives his or her certificate, into Senate House Passage.[128]\n", "The university has 114 libraries.[130] The Cambridge University Library is the central research library, which holds over 8Â million volumes. It is a legal deposit library, therefore it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[131] In addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library possesses more than 100,000 books. Furthermore, every college has a library as well, partially for the purposes of undergraduate teaching, and the older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library has more than 200,000 books printed before 1800, while Corpus Christi College's Parker Library possesses one of the greatest collections of medieval manuscripts in the world, with over 600 manuscripts.\n", "Cambridge University operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanic garden.[132] The Fitzwilliam Museum, is the art and antiquities museum, the Kettle's Yard is a contemporary art gallery, the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities, together with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world, the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside. This Museum also has specimens collected by Charles Darwin. Other museums include, the Museum of Classical Archaeology, the Whipple Museum of the History of Science, the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences which is the geology museum of the university, the Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men, and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n", "The Cambridge University Botanic Garden is the botanic garden of the university, created in 1831.\n", "The university's publishing arm, the Cambridge University Press, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world, and it is the second largest university press in the world.[133][134]\n", "The university set up its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858.

Held annually, The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge along a 4.2-mile (6.8Â km) tidal stretch of the River Thames in south-west London. For the fourth time in the history of the event, the men's, women's and both reserves' races were all held on the Tideway on the same day.\n", "The women's race was the first event of the day, and saw Cambridge lead from the start, eventually winning by a considerable margin. This is their third consecutive victory, taking the overall record in the Women's Boat Race to 44â30 in their favour.  The men's race was the final event of the day and completed a second consecutive whitewash as Cambridge won, their third victory in four years, and taking the overall record to 84â80 in their favour. In the women's reserve race, Cambridge's Blondie defeated Oxford's Osiris, their fourth consecutive victory.  The men's reserve race was won by Cambridge's Goldie who defeated Oxford's Isis.\n", "The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Blues\")[1] and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the \"Light Blues\").[1] First held in 1829, the race takes place on the 4.2-mile (6.8Â km) Championship Course, between Putney and Mortlake on the River Thames in south-west London.[2] The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; the race is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.[3][4] Cambridge went into the race as champions, having won the 2018 race by a margin of three lengths,[5] and led overall with 83 victories to Oxford's 80 (excluding the 1877 race, officially a dead heat though claimed as a victory by the Oxford crew).[6][7]\n", "It was the fourth time in the history of The Boat Race that all four senior races â the men's, women's, men's reserves' and women's reserves' â were held on the same day and on the same course along the Tideway. Prior to 2015, the women's race, which first took place in 1927, was usually held at the Henley Boat Races along the 2,000-metre (2,200Â yd) course.  However, on at least two occasions in the interwar period, the women competed on the Thames between Chiswick and Kew.[8] Cambridge's women went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 2018 race by seven lengths, and led 43â30 overall.[5]\n", "The autumn reception, where the previous year's losing team challenges the winners to a rematch, was held at the Guildhall in London on 8 November 2018.  As Cambridge's women had won the previous year's race, it was Oxford's responsibility to offer the traditional challenge to the Cambridge University Women's Boat Club (CUWBC). To that end, Eleanor Shearer, President of Oxford University Women's Boat Club (OUWBC), laid down the gauntlet to Abigail Parker, her Cambridge counterpart. Cambridge's victory in the men's race meant that Felix Drinkall, President of Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC), challenged Dara Alizadeh, President of Cambridge University Boat Club (CUBC).[9]\n", "The 74th women's race was umpired by Richard Phelps, a former rower who successfully represented Cambridge in the 1993, 1994 and 1995 races. He has previously umpired the men's race once, in 2014. The 165th men's race was umpired by Rob Clegg who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1994, 1995 and 1996 races. He umpired the women's race in 2016.[10]  The women's reserve race was overseen by Tony Reynolds, while the men's reserve race was umpired by multiple Olympic gold-medallist Matthew Pinsent.[10] As well as rowing for Oxford in the 1990, 1991 and 1993 races,[11][12][13] he was assistant umpire in the 2012 race before umpiring the 2013 men's race and the 2018 women's race.[14][15][16]\n", "On 30 January 2019, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution was announced as the official charity partner for the event.[17]\n", "The Cambridge men's crew coaching team was led by their chief coach, Rob Baker, who had previously coached CUWBC to victories in both the 2017 and 2018 races.[18] He was assisted by Richard Chambers, silver medallist in the men's lightweight coxless four at the 2012 Summer Olympics.[18] Donald Legget, who rowed for the Light Blues in the 1963 and 1964 races acted as a supporting coach, along with coxing coach Henry Fieldman (who steered Cambridge in the 2013 race) and the medical officer Simon Owens.[18] Sean Bowden was chief coach for Oxford, having been responsible for the senior men's crew since 1997, winning 12 from 19 races. He is a former Great Britain Olympic coach and coached the Light Blues in the 1993 and 1994 Boat Races.[19]\n", "Cambridge women's chief coach was Robert Weber, who joined Cambridge University from Hamilton College in New York, where he was Head Rowing Coach and Associate Professor of Physical Education. He was assisted by Paddy Ryan and Astrid Cohnen.[20] Oxford women's chief coach was the former OUBC assistant coach Andy Nelder, who previously worked with Bowden for eleven years. He was assisted by James Powell.[21]\n", "Dates for the trials, where crews are able to simulate the race proper on the Championship Course, were announced on 23 November 2018.[22]\n", "Oxford's women's trial took place on the Championship Course on 7 December, between Blitzen and Comet, named after two of Santa Claus's reindeer.[23] Comet, coxed by the OUWBC president Eleanor Shearer, took an early lead and held a length's advantage by Craven Cottage.  Extending their lead to two lengths by Hammersmith Bridge, Comet moved across Blitzen to control the remainder of the race.  In deteriorating conditions, Comet coped better and won by three lengths.[24]\n", "Cambridge's trial race was held on the Championship Course on 10 December, between Curie and Suttner, named after Nobel Prize winners Marie Curie and Bertha von Suttner.[25]  Suttner won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.  Curie held an early lead but a push from Suttner towards Hammersmith Bridge levelled the race, with the umpire Richard Phelps having to warn both crews for encroachment.  A clash of blades halfway down Chiswick Eyot resulted in Suttner's bow rower being unseated; Curie took advantage and rowed several lengths clear before the umpire halted the race.  After the restart from Chiswick Pier, Curie held a slight lead at Barnes Bridge and took advantage of the bend of the river to pass the finishing line with a clear-water advantage.[26]\n", "Oxford's trial race was held on the Championship Course on 7 December, between Reggie and Flea, named in commemoration of Second Lieutenant Reginald Fletcher, who rowed for OUBC in the 1914 race, and Lieutenant Colonel William Fletcher, a member of the Dark Blue crew in four consecutive races between 1890 and 1893.[23]  It took place without Oxford's president, Felix Drinkall, who was absent due to injury.  After a close start and in windy, wet conditions, Flea took a slight advantage while Reggie was warned for encroachment.  More aggressive steering from Reggie around the Hammersmith bend saw them take a half-length lead which they maintained past St Paul's School.  Flea pushed along Chiswick Eyot and in calmer waters re-took the lead and were a length ahead as they rowed away from Barnes Bridge.  They increased their lead to pass the finishing line nearly two lengths ahead of Reggie.[27]\n", "Cambridge's men's trial took place on the Championship Course on 10 December, between Roger and Lancelot, also named in honour of two alumni killed in action during the First World War.[25]  Lieutenant Colonel Roger Kerrison had rowed in the 1893 and 1894 races while Lieutenant Lancelot Ridley coxed in both the 1913 and 1914 races.[25]  Roger won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, with the race taking place in \"testing conditions\".[28] Following warnings from the umpire Rob Clegg, Roger was forced to steer off-course, allowing Lancelot to take advantage, and hold a lead of more than a length by Hammersmith Bridge. They continued to dominate the race and crossed the finishing line several lengths ahead of Roger.[28]\n", "The official fixtures to be raced in advance of The Boat Race were announced on 11 February 2019.[29]\n", "On 23 February 2019, CUWBC faced a crew from Nereus Rowing Club in two races along sections of the Championship Course.  In good weather conditions, the first piece saw Nereus take an early lead, with the Dutch crew holding a length's lead by Fulham Wall.  CUWBC's cox steered a wide course into slower water allowing Nereus to extend their lead to three lengths by the Mile Post.  Although CUWBC reduced the deficit by a length on the approach to the Harrods Furniture Depository, the race concluded at Chiswick Steps with Nereus two lengths ahead.[30]  The second race, from Chiswick Eyot to the finishing post, started well for Cambridge who held a slender lead until Barnes Bridge whereupon Nereus drew level, and following a push, crossed the finishing line a quarter of a length ahead.[30]  Two days later, OUWBC raced in a three-piece set of five-minute races along the Championship Course against Imperial College, umpired by Richard Phelps. Starting from Putney Bridge, the first race saw Oxford take an early lead which they extended with ease to pass the winning line at Harrods by four lengths. Imperial started the second race, commencing from St Paul's School, with a length's head start.  Oxford were level within two minutes and despite being warned for steering infringements, went on to win the race by three lengths.  The third piece started with a half-length head start to Imperial, and once again, although Oxford were warned for aggressive steering, they closed the gap quickly and had clear water advantage with two minutes of the race remaining.  They won the race by three and a half lengths.[31]\n", "CUWBC raced their final fixture on 3 March 2019 against Oxford Brookes University Boat Club (OBUBC) in three pieces.  Taking place in poor and worsening conditions, the first race, from the start to the Mile Post, was close throughout, but Cambridge led from the outset and passed the finish line half a length ahead.  The second piece, from Harrods to Chiswick Steps, once again saw Cambridge take the lead and with OBUBC's cox steering to avoid windy conditions, CUWBC pulled away to a clear win.  The final race, from the Bandstand to the finishing post, was dominated again by Cambridge who coped with the difficult conditions better than their opposition, to win by three and a half lengths.[32] OUWBC faced a crew from Molesey in a two-piece set along the Championship Course on 23 March 2019.  In the first race, from Putney to Chiswick Eyot, Molesey took an early lead, but with the course of the river in the Dark Blues' favour, OUWBC drew level by Craven Cottage, on the straight towards Hammersmith Bridge.  OUWBC continued to press and extended their lead out to one and a half lengths before passing the finish line at Chiswick.  The second piece, between Chiswick and the finishing post, saw Molesey take the lead once again before Oxford redressed the balance by Barnes Bridge.  A hard-fought race ended with OUWBC passing the finishing line a quarter of a length ahead.[33]\n", "OUBC were scheduled to race against OBUBC on 10 March 2019, but the fixture was postponed as a result of poor weather conditions.[34] The fixture was reorganised and took place on 17 March 2019, in two pieces.[35]  The first race was from Chiswick Steps to Beverley Brook, and despite OUBC winning the toss and taking the more favourable Surrey side of the river, it was Oxford Brookes who took the early lead.  By Hammersmith Bridge, OBUBC had a clear water advantage over the Dark Blues, finishing the race well ahead.  The second piece, along the same section of the Championship Course, saw the crews switch starting stations, but a similar outcome.  OUBC made a good start but OBUBC quickly overtook them and pulled away to win comfortably.[35]  On 23 March 2019, OUBC raced against Leander Club from the Championship Course start line to Chiswick Steps.  From the start, it was a close fixture with neither boat showing real dominance and the umpire Rob Clegg having to issue multiple warnings as both crews infringed each others' racing line.  Oxford held a slight lead by the Mile Post but Leander responded to draw level as the crews passed Harrods, and took the lead at Chiswick Eyot.  Warned once again by the umpire, Leander course correction allowed the Dark Blues into faster water, and into a canvas lead which they held to the conclusion of the race.[36]\n", "The fixture between CUBC and OBUBC, due to be held on 13 March 2019 but postponed because of adverse weather, was held on 24 March.  The OBUBC crew included World Champion gold medallist Matthew Tarrant and former Dark Blue Josh Bugajski.  In the first of two pieces, CUBC took early advantage and were ahead at the Mile Post, but Oxford Brookes responded at Harrods with a push to see them move ahead.  With the bend in the river against the Light Blues, OBUBC extended their lead to three-quarters of a length along Chiswick Eyot and winning the race.  The second piece once again saw CUBC take the lead, almost out to a length, before a clash of oars resulted in one of the CUBC oarsmen catching a crab.  OBUBC moved past Cambridge and despite efforts to row with a broken backstay, CUBC ended the race nearly a length behind their opponents.[37]\n", "The official weigh-in for the crews took place at City Hall, London, on 14 March 2019, and was hosted by BBC broadcaster Andrew Cotter.[38]\n", "The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 72.3 kilograms (159Â lb), 1.2 kilograms (2.6Â lb) more per rower than their opponents, and stand at an average height of 178.9Â cm (5Â ft 10Â 1â2Â in), 1.8 centimetres (0.71Â in) taller than Oxford.[39] OUWBC saw two former Blues return from last year's crew, in RenÃ©e Koolschijn and Beth Bridgman, while Cambridge's crew contained just one rower with Boat Race experience: Tricia Smith was a member of the victorious 2018 Light Blue boat.[39]\n", "The Oxford crew weighed an average of 90.0Â kg (198.4Â lb), just 0.2Â kg (0.4Â lb) more than their opponents, while the average height of rowers in each crew was identical, at 194.6Â cm (6Â ft 4Â 1â2Â in).[40] The Dark Blues included two rowers who had participated in the previous year's race in the OUBC president Felix Drinkall and Benedict Aldous. Cambridge also included two former Blues, Dara Alizadeh and Freddie Davidson (who had also rowed in the 2017 race), and Matthew Holland, who had coxed CUWBC to victory in 2017.[38] The Light Blue crew also contained two-time Olympic champion James Cracknell who, at the age of 46, became the oldest competitor to take part in the Boat Race.[41]\n", "The OUBC crew was modified prior to the race from that which was presented at the official introduction at City Hall.  Charlie Buchanan replaced Benedict Aldous, and rowed in the seven seat, while cox Anna Carbery was replaced by Toby de Mendonca.[43]  The races were held on 7 April 2019 in overcast conditions.[44]\n", "Cambridge's Blondie and Goldie won the women's and men's reserve races respectively.[45]\n", "CUWBC won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey side of the river, handing the Middlesex side to Oxford.  Weather conditions for the race, which started at 2.14Â p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), were 11Â Â°C (52Â Â°F), overcast but calm.  The Light Blues took an early lead and by Craven Cottage were a length ahead.  They continued to extend their advantage, and eventually passed the finishing post in a time of 18 minutes 47 seconds, five lengths ahead of their opponents.[44][46] It was Cambridge's third consecutive victory but only their fourth win in twelve years, and took the overall record in the event to 44â30 in their favour.[5][44]\n", "CUBC won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey side of the river, leaving Oxford with the Middlesex side.  The race started at 3.12Â p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the Light Blues were quickly ahead, taking a half a length advantage within thirty seconds.  Despite several warnings from the umpire, an oar clash followed but eventually CUBC steered wider to avoid further sanction.  By Hammersmith Bridge, OUBC were four seconds behind, but began to recover some of the gap as the crews passed Chiswick Steps.  The Light Blues maintained their lead and passed the finishing post in a time of 16 minutes 57 seconds, 28 seconds slower than the course record, but 2 seconds and 1 length ahead of their opponents.[44]  The Oxford cox raised a protest, but it was declined.[43] It was Cambridge's third victory in the last four years, and took the overall record in the event to 84â80 in their favour.[5]\n", "After the victory, Cracknell's former Olympic teammate Matthew Pinsent described his colleague's achievement as \"off the scale\".[47] \n", "CUWBC stroke Lily Lindsay stated that despite having featured in international rowing for the United States, that rowing in the Boat Race was incomparable, and \"training alongside my team-mates has been unbelievable. It's been a pleasure\".[47]\n"]}2  : {""=>#<URI::HTTPS https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>, "Jump to navigation"=>#<URI::HTTPS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Iran_floods#mw-head>,

flooding affected large areas of Iran, most severely in Golestan, Fars, Khuzestan, Lorestan, and other provinces. Iran has been hit by three major waves of rain and flooding over the course of two weeks[3]which led to flooding in at least 26 of Iranâs 31 provinces.[4] and at least 70 people died nationwide as of 6Â April, according to the officials.[5]\n", "Coincident with Iran's national holiday, Nowruz,[6] the first wave of rain began on March 17, leading to flooding in two northern provinces, Golestan and Mazandaran with the former province receiving as much as 70 percent of its average annual rainfall in single day.[7] Several large dams have been overflowed, particularly in Khuzestan and Golestan, therefor, many villages and several cities have been evacuated.[8] According to Iranian official, due to record rainfalls, more than 140 rivers have burst their banks and about 409 landslides have happened in the country. About 1,900 cities and villages across country have been damaged by severe floods as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to water and agriculture infrastructures. 78 roads had been blocked and 84 bridges in flood-stricken areas affected.[9] In many areas, homes and lands have been partially or totally submerged for several days.[5]  Impact of the floods was heightened because of the Nowruz holiday; many Iranians were travelling and many deaths occurred due to flash flooding on roads and highways.  \n", "On March 23, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, commanded the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to participate in the relief efforts.[10] Civil and armed forces have been mobilized since March 24 and Eshaq Jahangiri along with several ministers as well as army commanders have traveled to the areas affected by floods.[11] According to Iranian Red Cross, several thousands of tents, blankets, heaters, health sets as well as mineral water and food have been distributed among those affected by floods.[12] However the lack of government aid at the first week and delayed response quickly heightened political tensions throughout the nation. Many Iranians including politicians took social media platforms to criticize the handling of the floods by the government, specifically Hassan Rouhani.[13]\n", "On 20 March 2019, massive rainfall in the two provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran in Iran brought about heavy flooding.[14] These floods resulted in financial damages to the people living in these areas and also the death of two children.[15] State-run media reports indicated that flash floods had surfaced in 70 villages in Golestan and more than 200 villages in Mazandaran. \nIran's Minister of Energy also reported that 360 villages in Golestan province and 193 villages in Mazandaran province had lost electricity due to floods.[citation needed]\n", "Portions of Golestan province received 50-70Â percent of their average annual rainfall over a five-day period. Some areas recorded approximately 300Â mm (12Â in) of rainfall, equivalent to a year's-worth of rain. These amounts exceed any accumulations in the region in at least 70 years. The flooding in Golestan and Mazandaran provinces is considered a 1-in-100 year event.[16]\n", "On March 23, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, commanded to Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to participate in the relief efforts.[17] Civil and armed forces have been mobilized since March 24 and Eshaq Jahangiri with several ministers as well as army commanders have traveled to the areas which affected by floods to help people.[18]\n", "On 25 March, flash floods following heavy rains in Southwestern Iran in the vicinity of the city of Shiraz[19] killed 19 people[20] and injured more than 200 others.[21] Many people were traveling for the Nowruz holiday, and were injured or killed when their cars were swept off of roads. Rain was short but heavy, lasting in two bursts of approximately 15 minutes each; however, the impact was exacerbated by the heavy road traffic at the time. Iran's Meteorological Organisation gave warnings for further floods, as heavy rains were expected to last at least until 27 March.[22] The leader of the Iranian Ministry of Energy has stated that climate change was a contributing factor to the flooding.[22] As of 26 March 2019, 20 of Iran's 31 provinces are either currently flooded or facing the possibility of imminent flooding.[19]  \n", "A brief but intense rainfall caused a sudden flash flood that submerged a main highway between Shiraz and Esfahan, trapping many travelers who had been leaving the city after Nowruz celebrations. City officials did not warn the people of Shiraz of the deadly weather conditions resulting in many deaths.[23]\n", "The initial investigations of the Shiraz flash floods showed that a water canal  adjacent to the Quran Gate was paved over in the early 2000s for use as a road by the Shiraz municipality. The road expansion did not include a sufficient drainage system.[24]\n", "Heavy rains on 3 April, have completely overwhelmed several towns in the mountainous Lorestan province.[25]\nThe town of Poldokhtar in Lorestan Province was engulfed by flood water. After the floodwaters subsided, cars and homes remained sunken in thick layers of mud.[26] According to an internal police report, at least 90 people were killed when floods engulfed the western city of Poldokhtar in Lorestan province.[27]\nAccording to the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim News Agency, Heydari said that the conditions in Poldokhtar were \"horrific\".[28]\n", "The flooding caused the destruction hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure and the collapse of at least 314 bridges across the country.[29] Twenty-three of the nation's thirty-one provinces were affected. Agriculture suffered tremendous damage, with losses in the sector reaching 46Â trillion rials (US$1.1Â billion) by 3 April. Golestan accounted for the largest portion at 20Â trillion rials (US$480Â million).[30] At least 25,000 houses were completely destroyed, while another 60,000 sustained some form of damage.[31]\n", "Mohamad Hossein Talebian, deputy chairman of Iranâs Cultural Heritage Organization reported on 27 March that \"cracks on the ancient reliefs in Naqsh-e Rustam in Fars province are widening in a critical way.\" Social media reports revealed a waterfall made by the floods that has been washing away parts of the monument. In April 1398, the floods caused severe damage to the city of Khorramabad The construction of a new and non-expert bridge on the Khorramabad River with a very low altitude from the river level has exacerbated and flooded the streets of Khorramabad city.[32]\n", "Although, according to Talebian, \"The Persepolis remains intact as its ancient water ducts have drained flood water.\" The ancient water ducts also protected the Tomb of Cyrus the Great and saved the internationally acclaimed site from destruction by the floods. Excavations of Great Wall of Gorgan were also damaged due to its close proximity to a dry riverbed which experienced flooding. The floods have damaged the Aq Qala bridge in northern Iran and several other centuries-old bridges in Isfahan and Shoushtar.[32]\n", " \t\nThe Government of Iran declared a state of emergency for Khuzestan Province on 31Â March.[33] President Hassan Rouhani deployed \"all available capacities\" to assist victims.[34]\n", "According to Iranian Red Cross, \"14,238 units of tents, 58,494 packs of blankets, 32,961 packs of ground sheets, 43,509 kgs of plastic sheets, 3,083 pcs of heaters, 2,851 health sets, 1355 kitchen sets, 227,696 bottles of mineral water, 125,993 canned food, 235,405 loaves of bread, 1,877 kgs of date, 41,992 kgs of rice, 9,485 kgs of edible oil, 3955 boxes of Biscuits, 8,710 kgs of sugar, 11,753 kgs of beans and 84,580 food packages\" have been distributed. In total, \"537,000 kgs of food and living items have been transferred through 556 flight hours and 1,970 relief and rescue workers were transported\". The relief services include proving basic supports such as food and water \"for more than 257,000 people and proving temporally shelters for more than 98,000 persons.\" In addition, \"1138 persons were transferred to safe areas and 89 persons transferred to the clinics.\"\n[35]\n", "Shortly after the floods began the Rouhani administration proceeded to ban all third party charities to help the flood relief effort citing that all donations must be made directly to the Iranian government thus preventing foreign aid from reaching the country.[36] The governor of Golestan province was also reportedly on vacation outside the country during the floods.[13] Authorities also banned foreign journalists from covering the flood stricken areas.[29] \n", "Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei were heavily criticized for their delayed response. Rouhani was on vacation on Iranâs Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf and returned to Tehran while the floods had begun subsiding.[37]\n", "The US State Department stated \"[We] offer our condolences to the victims of the recent floods in Iran,\" where dozens have been killed amid intense storms and rainfall and also stated \"floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness.\"[38]\n", "President Hassan Rouhani was heavily criticized for his delayed response. Rouhani suffered greater scrutiny after it was revealed that he was on vacation on Iranâs Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf and returned to Tehran while the floods had begun subsiding. The lack of aid and the presence of the Iranian government quickly prompted outrage among the victims of the floods. Iranians across the nation expressed their frustration by a Persian hashtag translated as \"Where is Rouhani?\" Iranians also began calling for Rouhaniâs resignation. \"Mr. Rouhani, you better submit your resignation from wherever you are. Your appearance will only open up people's wounds,\" read another tweet.[39]\n", "Many Iranians took to social media platforms to criticize the handling of the floods by the regime specifically Rouhani, while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Khamenei were also the targets of criticism.[29][40] Swedish-Iranian academic and researcher Ahmad Reza Jalali, currently on death row after being sentenced at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran, gave an interview to U.S. government-funded Radio Farda attributing the destruction of natural plant coverage, obstruction of flood outlets, and converting flood routes and dry river beds to residential areas following the Islamic Revolution were the causes of the flash floods in Shiraz.[41]\n", "The governor of Golestan province was also reportedly on vacation outside the country during the floods.[13]\n", "Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, and Ali Larijani, speaker of the Parliament, have condemned the United States which prevents the delivery of relief aid from the International Red Cross  by its sanctions against Iran.[42]\n[43] On the other hand, Mike Pompeo, United States Secretary of State, denied accusations and blamed Iran's government for mismanagement.[44]\n"]}3  : {""=>#<URI::HTTPS https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>, "Jump to navigation"=>#<URI::HTTPS

commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The president is directly elected by the people for five years, and can be elected for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The presidency is largely a ceremonial office, but the president does exercise certain limited powers with absolute discretion. The president's official residence is the Grassalkovich Palace in Bratislava.\n", "The office was established by the constitution of Slovakia on 1 January 1993 when Slovakia permanently split from Czechoslovakia and became independent. The office was vacant until 2 March 1993 when the first president Michal KovÃ¡Ä was elected by the National Council of Slovak Republic. However, in 1998, the National Council was unable to elect a successor to KovÃ¡Ä. The result was that for half a year after KovÃ¡Ä's term ended in March 1998, the position was vacant. The duties and powers of the office were devolved upon the then prime minister and speaker of the National Council. In order to come to a solution, the constitution was changed to transfer election of the president to the people. Presidential elections have been held in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014.\n", "The current president is Andrej Kiska, who took office on 15 June 2014.\n", "The President of Slovakia has a limited role in policy-making, as the office is largely ceremonial. According to the constitution, the president is the supreme representative of the state both in Slovakia and abroad.\n", "Among the President's constitutional powers are nominating and appointing the Prime Minister, three judges of the constitutional court and three members of the judicial council. The president can also veto any bill or proposal by the National Council, except for constitutional amendments. This veto can be overridden if the National Council passes the same bill again with a majority of all members of the Council, similar to the US system of presidential veto. The president also acts as the commander-in-chief of the Slovak armed forces.\n", "Among their other constitutional duties are signing bills into the law, appointing ministers on the recommendation of the prime minister and appointing various other state officials: generals, professors, judges, rectors, procurators and such. The president can grant pardon, amnesty, commutations, and parole on the recommendation of the minister of justice.\n", "Â Â HZDS\nÂ Â SOP\nÂ Â HZD\nÂ Â PS\nÂ Â Independent\n", "Zuzana ÄaputovÃ¡ of the Progressive Slovakia party finished far ahead of the other candidates, receiving 40.6% of the votes, but failed to achieve the necessary threshold of 50%+1 vote from all registered voters to avoid a run-off. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, the Vice-President of the European Commission for the Energy Union, who was running as an independent supported by the governing Smer-SD,[2] was the runner-up with 18.7% of the vote and earned the other place in the run-off. Voter turnout in the first round was 48.74%, the highest percentage for that stage of presidential elections since direct voting for the position was introduced in 1999.[3]\n", "In the second round, ÄaputovÃ¡ won election to the presidency, garnering 58.4% of the vote to Å efÄoviÄ's 41.6%. She became the first woman to be elected to the position and will become Slovakia's youngest-ever president upon her inauguration on 15 June 2019.[4] The second round turnout of just 41.80% was the lowest for any round of presidential elections in Slovakia.[5] The number of votes with which ÄaputovÃ¡ was elected to office is also the lowest for any directly elected Slovakian president to date.[5]\n", "\n", "There are two living former Slovak Presidents:\n"]}
